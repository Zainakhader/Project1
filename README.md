# SALES PREDICTION PROJECT
## Understanding Sales Trends and Patterns
**Author** : Zaina Khader
### Business problem:
The goal of this project is to predict sales of food items across various stores to enable retailers to optimize their product offerings and store strategies for maximizing revenue.
### Data:

**[Download Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syH81TVrbBsdymLT_jl2JIf6IjPXtSQw/view)**

-The dataset includes historical sales data for food items across multiple stores. It consists of 8523 observations and includes features such as Item Type, Outlet Type, and Item Visibility.
## Methods
- Cleaned missing values and outliers.
- Finded and fixed inconsistent categories of data.
- Visualized seasonal trends and correlations between variables.
## Model
- the Random Forest model after tuning outperforms both the linear regression model and the default Random Forest model in terms of R-squared, MAE, and RMSE on the test data.
- R-squared is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the target variable and I selected RMSE because it provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors made by the model in predicting the target variable. In simpler terms, it represents the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
## Recommendations:
Based on the analysis and insights gained from the predictive model, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance sales performance:
-Optimize Inventory Management: Utilize sales forecasts to manage stock levels more efficiently, reducing instances of overstock or stockouts.

-Personalize Marketing Strategies: Leverage insights on consumer preferences and seasonal trends to tailor marketing campaigns and promotions.
## Limitations & Next Steps
**Limitations**
-Data Availability: The quality and completeness of historical data may impact the accuracy of predictions.

-Model Assumptions: Simplified assumptions in the model may overlook complex interactions between variables.

**Next Steps**
-Enhanced Data Collection: Incorporate additional data sources, such as customer demographics or competitor analysis, to enrich predictive capabilities.

-Continuous Model Refinement: Implement ongoing model updates and validations to adapt to changing market dynamics and consumer behaviors.
